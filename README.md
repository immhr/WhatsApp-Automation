# WhatsApp Automation Integrated with ChatGPT

## Overview
This Python program harnesses the power of GPT 3.5 for automating WhatsApp conversations. By intelligently analyzing messages, it produces natural responses, eliminating the need for manual typing or swiping on your phone. This integration enhances convenience, making communication more efficient.

## Features
**ChatGPT Integration:** The program utilizes the OpenAI GPT 3.5 API to generate context-aware and natural language responses for WhatsApp messages.

**Automated Conversations:** Messages are analyzed and responded to automatically, reducing the need for manual input and streamlining communication.

**Python Libraries:** The project makes use of PyAutoGUI for automating user interactions on the computer, and pyperclip for clipboard operations.

## Tools Used
**Python:** The primary programming language used for automation and interaction with the OpenAI API.

**PyAutoGUI:** A Python library for automating mouse and keyboard interactions, used for simulating user actions on the computer.

**pyperclip:** Facilitates clipboard operations, enabling seamless data transfer between the program and the system clipboard.

**OpenAI API:** Utilizes the GPT 3.5 API for natural language processing and generating context-aware responses.

## Learning Outcome
This project reflects the developer's acquired skills in automating applications and efficiently using APIs. By integrating ChatGPT into a WhatsApp automation script, the developer gained practical experience in leveraging external services to enhance user interactions.
